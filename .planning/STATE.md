# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Agent workflows run uninterrupted when the browser is closed — reconnect anytime from any device on the tailnet and pick up where you left off.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — remote-access-settings-ui

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (remote-access-settings-ui) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: scrypt over bcrypt — built into Node.js, no external dependency
- [Init]: Cookie auth for Tailscale, bearer token for localhost — Secure cookies require HTTPS
- [Init]: HMAC-SHA256 signed session tokens — stateless, no database needed
- [Init]: JSONL event log with monotonic sequence numbers — append-only, survives restarts
- [Init]: jose ^6.2.2 needed for Edge Runtime HMAC — node:crypto unavailable in Next.js middleware
- [Phase 01-password-auth-and-cookie-sessions]: Named password storage web-password-storage.ts (not web-auth-storage.ts) to avoid conflict with existing OAuth storage module
- [Phase 01-password-auth-and-cookie-sessions]: Use .ts import extensions throughout (not .js) to match project convention and Node 22+ native TypeScript test execution
- [Phase 01-password-auth-and-cookie-sessions]: Auth routes use .ts import extensions (not .js) to match Next.js workspace convention
- [Phase 01-password-auth-and-cookie-sessions]: verifySessionCookieEdge uses crypto.subtle directly (not jose) — custom HMAC token, no jose benefit, zero deps
- [Phase 01-password-auth-and-cookie-sessions]: authFetch HTTPS path passes requests through for cookie auth; on 401 clears local state and reloads to login page
- [Phase 01-password-auth-and-cookie-sessions]: LoginGate uses window.location.protocol check to skip auth gate on HTTP localhost
- [Phase 02-tailscale-serve-integration]: _deps object pattern for testability — Node.js strip-only mode cannot mock named exports from node:child_process
- [Phase 02-tailscale-serve-integration]: stopTailscaleServe split into strict/lenient modes — startup reset throws, shutdown cleanup swallows
- [Phase 02-tailscale-serve-integration]: cleanupFired guard uses local variable name (not tailscaleCleanupFired) for idempotent SIGINT/SIGTERM handler
- [Phase 02-tailscale-serve-integration]: Tailscale lifecycle vars hoisted before if(options.tailscale) block so resolution fields are available for failure objects
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: Sync appendFileSync in EventLog.append() guarantees seq ordering under concurrent emits
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: Inline rotation trigger every 100 appends plus hourly fallback setInterval for burst protection
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: Atomic POSIX rename for log rotation keeps active readline streams on old inode safe
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: Replay ceiling captures eventLog.currentSeq before readSince() starts — prevents duplicate delivery of events that arrive during file read
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: liveBuffer overflow sends snapshot event — prevents unbounded memory growth per SSE connection
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: No-cursor SSE path uses unnamed encodeSseData for backward compat with onmessage clients
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: Project-scoped localStorage key (gsd-last-seq:<projectCwd>) prevents cursor bleed across projects
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: lastAppliedSeq kept in-memory per tab to prevent multi-tab cursor interference without locking
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: REPLAY_UNSAFE_EVENT_TYPES filters live_state_invalidation and extension_ui_request during replay to prevent side effects
- [Phase 03-sse-cursor-based-event-replay]: isCatchingUp set before EventSource creation so banner appears immediately on reconnect (D-01)
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: Test stubs placed at src/web/ (not __tests__/) per plan frontmatter spec
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: Password change at /api/settings/password (not /api/auth/) to require authentication via middleware
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: Tailscale route maps fqdn->dnsName and url->tailnetUrl to bridge Phase 2 field names to Phase 4 UI contract
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: getInstallCommand returns display string not array — split on space at call site for spawn
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: getTailscaleStatus returns discriminated union { ok, info } — verify step checks result.ok
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: Shield icon (not ShieldCheck) used for remote-access section to distinguish from auth section
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: Set up Tailscale button hidden when connected or no password configured — prevents setup confusion
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: Shield icon (not ShieldCheck) used for remote-access section to distinguish from auth section
- [Phase 04-remote-access-settings-ui]: Set up Tailscale button hidden when connected or no password configured — prevents setup confusion

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: SSE `request.signal` AbortSignal has known gaps in Next.js App Router (vercel/next.js #61972) — validate heartbeat + abort pattern before committing to it in Phase 3
- [Research]: Log rotation during active readline replay needs POSIX rename verification on Linux container target
- [Research]: `tailscale serve --bg` requires v1.44+ — preflight check must detect older installs and emit upgrade message
