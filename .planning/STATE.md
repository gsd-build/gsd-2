## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** A developer types in Mission Control's chat, Claude Code executes, code lands, and dashboard panels update in real time — the full build loop in one window.
**Current focus:** Phase 11.1 — Pre-v2.0 Stabilization (inserted, must complete before Phase 12)

## Current Position

Phase: 14 of 20 (Slice Integration) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 3 of 5 complete (plan 03 done — SlicePlanned, SliceInProgress, SliceRow dispatcher)
Status: Phase 14 in progress — ready for plan 14-04 (wave 2)
Last activity: 2026-03-13 — Plan 14-02 complete: SliceAccordion container; MilestoneHeader with totalCost/budget bar; Slice tab removed from TabLayout; MilestoneView uses gsd2State; 617 tests pass

Progress: [████████░░] 83% (19/23 plans complete)

## Milestone Archive

- **v1.0 MVP** — shipped 2026-03-12
  - 15 phases, 48 plans, ~12,744 LOC TypeScript/TSX
  - Archive: `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
  - Requirements: `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Accumulated Context

**Repo:** `gsd-build/gsd-2` fork, branch `feat/mission-control-m2`, located at `C:\Users\Bantu\mzansi-agentive\gsd-2`
**Dev command:** `cd packages/mission-control && bun dev` (or `bun run mc:dev` from root)
**GSD 2 CLI binary:** `gsd` (not `claude`), config dir `.gsd/` (not `.planning/`)
**Pi SDK:** `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` — structured NDJSON event stream
**Phase numbering:** v2.0 starts at Phase 12 (v1.0 ended at Phase 11)

### Phase Dependencies (v2.0)

- 12 → 13, 14, 15 (all unblock after 12)
- 15 → 16, 17
- 13 + 14 + 16 + 17 → 18
- 18 → 19
- 15 + 19 → 20

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 11.1 inserted after Phase 11: Pre-v2.0 Stabilization — address CONCERNS.md before v2.0 (URGENT)

### Decisions

- **11.1-00:** Tested CORS behavior inline rather than importing server.ts (which has Bun.serve side effects at module load)
- **11.1-00:** Used renderToString from react-dom/server for ErrorBoundary tests — RTL not installed in project
- **11.1-00:** wire-guard test simulates double-wiring with standalone helper, avoiding real Claude process spawning
- **11.1-01:** PipelineOptions.processFactory injection enables config-derived skipPermissions to reach test doubles and real ClaudeProcessManager
- **11.1-01:** switchProject updates SessionManager processFactory via indexed property access rather than rebuilding — preserves session state during project switch
- **11.1-01:** server-cors.test.ts RED stub updated alongside real server.ts fix — inline mirror pattern requires test update when implementation changes
- **11.1-03:** React 19 renderToString no longer triggers error boundary lifecycle — error-boundary test updated to direct class instance testing (getDerivedStateFromError + render())
- **11.1-03:** logo-anim-* CSS classes removed from animations.css; LogoAnimation, LoadingLogo, GsdLogo now use img tags pointing to official brand assets in public/assets/
- [Phase 11.1]: wired flag lives on SessionState rather than a Set in pipeline.ts — co-located with session object, avoids closure coupling
- [Phase 11.1]: validateConfigState uses manual typeof field-by-field checks rather than Zod — no new dependencies, consistent with project conventions
- [Phase 12-01]: Static source-text strategy for SettingsView tests: read SettingsView.tsx as string, assert GSD 2 field labels — avoids React hook rendering complexity in Bun test environment
- [Phase 12-01]: migration-banner and state-deriver GSD 2 tests are GREEN not RED because state-deriver.ts was already migrated to GSD 2 schema in the working tree before plan execution
- [Phase 12]: PlanningState aliased to GSD2State (not removed) so all 20+ import sites continue to compile in Phase 12
- [Phase 12]: v1 types (ProjectState, PhaseState, ConfigState) kept as deprecated stubs to prevent UI component breakage; to be removed in Phases 13-14
- [Phase 12]: pipeline.ts skip_permissions hardcoded to true, worktree_enabled to false — config.json is gone in GSD2; TODO Phase 13
- [Phase 12]: parseGSD2State splits on newline-triple-dash to find all YAML blocks and uses the LAST one with valid GSD2 fields
- [Phase 12-03]: --resume flag removed entirely; Phase 13 will implement gsd session continuity
- [Phase 12-03]: planningDir variable name preserved throughout — only the string value changed from .planning to .gsd
- [Phase 12-04]: GSD_COMMANDS rewritten to exactly 9 GSD 2 entries; all 22 v1 /gsd:* entries removed
- [Phase 12-04]: MigrationBanner uses inline style for amber border (#F59E0B) and surface background (#131C2B); ChatView tracks dismissal via useState
- [Phase 12]: SettingsView: replaced Claude Code Options section with AI Model Settings (four per-phase selects + budget_ceiling + skill_discovery)
- [Phase 12]: settings-api.ts project tier changed from config.json to preferences.md YAML frontmatter via gray-matter
- [Phase 12]: planningState.projectState.last_activity used for TaskWaiting lastCompleted prop — GSD2State.project is string | null (raw markdown), not an object; projectState: GSD2ProjectState has last_activity?: string
- [Phase 12-07]: ChatView v1 derivation block replaced with stub constants (undefined/false) + TODO Phase 13-14 comment — defers GSD2State task display rebuild while eliminating runtime TypeError
- [Phase 13-01]: GSD2StreamEvent uses 'kind' discriminant (not 'type') to avoid collision with existing StreamEvent.type field
- [Phase 13-01]: classifyPiSdkEvent validates required fields per variant — missing fields return null (strict degradation, never throws)
- [Phase 13]: process_crashed cast as unknown as StreamEvent to pass through existing handler infrastructure — GSD2StreamEvent richer typing deferred to plan 13-05
- [Phase 13]: killAll() uses Promise.all on listSessions() map — concurrent kill, no registry removal (shutdown-only hook)
- [Phase 13]: isReconnect(attemptBeforeConnect) extracted as pure helper for testability — mirrors calculateBackoffDelay/shouldProcessMessage pattern
- [Phase 13]: wsRef pattern in usePlanningState — ref to ReconnectingWebSocketResult so onReconnect always calls latest send() without stale closure
- [Phase 13]: applyGSD2Event is a pure exported helper tested without React; interrupt() sends WebSocket message not direct processManager call
- [Phase 13]: computeCostState uses float rounding (Math.round * 1e10) to prevent threshold failures at exact 80% boundary
- [Phase 13]: ChatView accepts costState as a pure render prop — useCostTracker wired in plan 13-05 via useSessionManager
- [Phase 13]: Live GSD 2 session verification deferred — all 578 automated tests pass; manual SC-1 through SC-5 will be validated when GSD 2 CLI is installed
- [Phase 13]: session_interrupt is fire-and-forget: no publishSessionUpdate needed, interrupt causes no metadata change
- [Phase 13]: TypeScript discriminant narrowing on action.type correctly resolves action.sessionId inside session_interrupt case without casting
- [Phase 14-slice-integration]: parseRoadmap uses regex-based section parsing (## S01 headings) not a structured format — matches actual GSD2 roadmap markdown layout
- [Phase 14-slice-integration]: GSD2TaskSummary now has taskId/sliceId/summary(200 chars) fields — not raw string; backward-compat tests updated
- [Phase 14-slice-integration]: readGitBranchData checks branch existence before querying count/message — defaults to 0/''
- [Phase 14]: MilestoneView prop renamed planningState → gsd2State; SingleColumnView updated to pass gsd2State= in same commit
- [Phase 14]: MilestoneHeader totalCost derived from slices[].costEstimate sum; budget bar only renders when budgetCeiling is non-null and >0
- [Phase 14]: TabLayout Slice tab removed; Start next slice button disabled when no WebSocket handler wired yet — graceful degradation
- [Phase 14]: SliceRow StatusBadge as inline helper to avoid unnecessary file proliferation for display-only component
- [Phase 14]: SlicePlanned canStart = slice.dependencies.every(dep => dep.complete) gates Start this slice button; border-l-2 animate-pulse for in_progress amber indicator without full-card pulse

### Blockers/Concerns
