# Requirements

This file is the explicit capability and coverage contract for the project.

Use it to track what is actively in scope, what has been validated by completed work, what is intentionally deferred, and what is explicitly out of scope.

Guidelines:
- Keep requirements capability-oriented, not a giant feature wishlist.
- Requirements should be atomic, testable, and stated in plain language.
- Every **Active** requirement should be mapped to a slice, deferred, blocked with reason, or moved out of scope.
- Each requirement should have one accountable primary owner and may have supporting slices.
- Research may suggest requirements, but research does not silently make them binding.
- Validation means the requirement was actually proven by completed work and verification, not just discussed.

## Active

### R001 — SQLite DB layer with schema versioning
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: A SQLite database at `.gsd/gsd.db` using `better-sqlite3` with typed wrappers, schema init, and forward-only versioned migrations
- Why it matters: Foundation for all structured storage — nothing else works without this
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: WAL mode enabled. Schema version tracked in `schema_version` table.

### R002 — Graceful fallback to markdown if better-sqlite3 unavailable
- Class: failure-visibility
- Status: active
- Description: If `better-sqlite3` fails to load (native addon build failure, unsupported platform), the system falls back to current markdown file loading with no crash
- Why it matters: GSD ships as an npm package to diverse environments — a native addon failure must not break the product
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: M001/S03
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Fallback is transparent — same prompt output, just without token savings

### R003 — Markdown importers for all artifact types
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: Importers that parse existing markdown files (DECISIONS.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, roadmaps, plans, summaries, contexts, research, continues, queue, secrets manifest, PROJECT.md) into DB rows using existing parsers from `files.ts`
- Why it matters: Existing projects must seamlessly transition to DB storage without data loss
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Reuses `parseRoadmap`, `parsePlan`, `parseSummary`, `parseContinue`, `parseRequirementCounts`, `parseSecretsManifest`, etc.

### R004 — Silent auto-migration on first run
- Class: primary-user-loop
- Status: active
- Description: On startup, if `.gsd/` exists with markdown files but no `gsd.db`, migration runs automatically with zero user interaction. One-line log summary.
- Why it matters: Must feel automagical — zero friction transition
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Detection: no gsd.db + markdown files present → migrate. Atomic transaction wraps all inserts.

### R005 — Selective context queries for decisions
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: Query active (non-superseded) decisions scoped by milestone, slice, and/or scope category. `active_decisions` view eliminates superseded rows.
- Why it matters: A project with 50 decisions where 20 are superseded currently injects all 50. This eliminates the 20 irrelevant ones.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: M001/S03
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Query patterns: planning gets milestone + global + architecture scope; task execution gets slice + architecture only

### R006 — Selective context queries for requirements
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: Query active (non-superseded) requirements filtered by status and/or slice ownership. `active_requirements` view eliminates superseded rows.
- Why it matters: Requirements with 30 entries (12+ lines each) get loaded in full even when the task touches 3
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: M001/S03
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Query patterns: planning gets all non-superseded; task execution gets only active mapped to current slice

### R007 — Context store query layer for all dispatch unit types
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: Typed query functions that return precisely the context needed for each dispatch unit type: research-milestone, plan-milestone, plan-slice, execute-task, complete-slice, complete-milestone, replan-slice, reassess-roadmap, run-uat
- Why it matters: Each unit type has different context needs — the query layer encodes the injection matrix from the PRD
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S03
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: See PRD Section 5 for the full injection matrix per unit type

### R008 — Prompt builder rewiring
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: Replace `inlineGsdRootFile()` calls in all `build*Prompt()` functions with targeted DB queries via the context store. Prompt output is equivalent or better.
- Why it matters: This is the integration point — where token savings actually happen
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S03
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Affects: buildResearchMilestonePrompt, buildPlanMilestonePrompt, buildPlanSlicePrompt, buildExecuteTaskPrompt, buildCompleteSlicePrompt, buildCompleteMilestonePrompt, buildReplanSlicePrompt, buildReassessRoadmapPrompt, buildRunUatPrompt

### R009 — Dual-write: markdown alongside DB
- Class: continuity
- Status: active
- Description: When the DB is the source of truth, markdown files continue to be written alongside for human readability, git history, and rollback safety
- Why it matters: Preserves the human-readable file trail and provides a rollback path — delete gsd.db and fall back to markdown
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S03
- Supporting slices: M001/S06
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Post-unit hooks or explicit write calls keep markdown in sync after DB writes

### R010 — Built-in token measurement
- Class: differentiator
- Status: active
- Description: Measure and log token counts per dispatch unit, showing before (markdown loading) vs after (DB query) savings
- Why it matters: User wants to see this is a good idea in practice — measurable proof, not trust
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S04
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Integrated into existing metrics system. Shows savings percentage per unit type.

### R011 — State derivation from DB
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: `deriveState()` reads from DB tables instead of scanning the `.gsd/` file tree and parsing markdown
- Why it matters: State derivation currently does O(N) file reads with batch native parsing. DB makes this a handful of indexed queries.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S04
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Must produce identical GSDState output to current implementation

### R012 — Worktree DB isolation
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: Each GSD worktree gets its own `gsd.db` at its `.gsd/` root, copied from the source branch on worktree creation
- Why it matters: Worktrees are isolated workspaces — DB state must be isolated too
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S05
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Existing worktree creation in `auto-worktree.ts` and `worktree-manager.ts` needs DB copy logic

### R013 — Worktree row-level merge reconciliation
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: When a worktree merges back, row-level reconciliation occurs with conflict detection. Deterministic PKs use INSERT OR REPLACE; auto-increment PKs remap sequences; conflicting rows flagged for review.
- Why it matters: Git can't merge binary SQLite files — need explicit reconciliation logic
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S05
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Three strategies per PRD: INSERT OR REPLACE for deterministic PKs, sequence remapping for auto-increment, conflict flagging for divergent modifications

### R014 — Structured LLM tools
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: Lightweight tool calls (gsd_save_decision, gsd_update_requirement, gsd_save_summary, etc.) that let the LLM write structured data directly to the DB, eliminating the markdown-then-parse roundtrip
- Why it matters: Eliminates the most fragile part of the pipeline — regex parsing of LLM-generated markdown
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S06
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: User emphasized "lightweight — whatever is fastest." Tools write to DB and trigger dual-write to markdown.

### R015 — /gsd inspect slash command
- Class: operability
- Status: active
- Description: A `/gsd inspect` command that dumps DB contents for debugging — table counts, recent entries, schema version, query results
- Why it matters: When something goes wrong, need visibility into DB state without external tooling
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S06
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Slash command inside pi, not a standalone CLI

### R016 — ≥30% token reduction in planning/research prompts
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: Planning and research dispatch unit prompts show at least 30% fewer tokens on projects with 20+ decisions and mature requirement sets
- Why it matters: The entire point — if this doesn't deliver measurable savings, the migration isn't worth it
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S04
- Supporting slices: M001/S03, M001/S07
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Measured via built-in token measurement (R010). Validated on real project data.

### R017 — Sub-5ms query latency
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: All context store queries complete in <5ms on local disk
- Why it matters: Must feel instant — no perceptible delay in prompt building
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: SQLite on local disk with WAL mode — this should be trivially achievable

### R018 — 100% migration fidelity
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: All data from markdown artifacts is recoverable from the DB after import — no silent data loss
- Why it matters: Trust in the migration — users must not lose project history
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Validated by round-trip tests: import markdown → export from DB → compare

### R019 — No regression in auto-mode output quality
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: Auto-mode produces equivalent or better output quality with DB-backed context compared to markdown loading
- Why it matters: Token reduction must not come at the cost of output quality
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S04
- Supporting slices: M001/S07
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Validated by running a real project through full auto-mode cycle

### R020 — WAL mode enabled
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: SQLite database opened with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for concurrent read performance
- Why it matters: WAL allows concurrent readers without blocking, and is faster for the read-heavy workload
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` on database open

### R021 — Schema designed for future vector search
- Class: constraint
- Status: active
- Description: Schema uses stable PKs and structures that allow a future Rust crate to add embedding virtual tables to the same gsd.db without schema conflicts
- Why it matters: Phase 4 (vector search) must be able to bolt on without schema rewrites
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Decisions use auto-increment `seq` as PK; requirements use stable `id` (R001, R002, ...). Both are joinable by future embedding tables.

## Validated

(none yet)

## Deferred

### R030 — Vector search layer
- Class: differentiator
- Status: deferred
- Description: Rust crate (`native/crates/vecstore`) that opens the same gsd.db and adds embedding virtual tables for semantic context retrieval
- Why it matters: Enables "find the 5 decisions most relevant to this task" — the next level of context curation
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Deferred to M002. Schema in M001 is designed to accommodate this.

### R031 — DB export command
- Class: operability
- Status: deferred
- Description: A `gsd db export` command that regenerates markdown files from DB contents for archival or migration
- Why it matters: Useful for debugging, backup, or moving to a system without SQLite
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Deferred — dual-write (R009) makes this less urgent since markdown files stay in sync

## Out of Scope

### R040 — Web UI/dashboard for DB contents
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: No web interface for browsing or editing DB contents
- Why it matters: Prevents scope creep — CLI inspection via /gsd inspect is sufficient
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: Explicitly excluded in PRD non-goals

### R041 — Multi-user/networked DB
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: No support for multiple users or networked database access
- Why it matters: SQLite is single-process. GSD is an agent-local store, not a collaboration database.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: Explicitly excluded in PRD non-goals

### R042 — Replacing git version control
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: The DB does not replace git. Version control stays as-is. DB is local derived state.
- Why it matters: Prevents confusion about what the DB is for
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: Explicitly excluded in PRD non-goals

### R043 — Real-time sync across machines
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: No sync of DB state across machines. Each clone rebuilds from its own artifacts.
- Why it matters: Prevents over-engineering for a problem that doesn't exist
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: Explicitly excluded in PRD non-goals

### R044 — Replacing prompt templates
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: Static instruction text (prompts/*.md, templates/*.md) stays as markdown files. Only data artifacts move to DB.
- Why it matters: Prompt templates are static text, not queryable data — moving them to DB adds complexity with zero benefit
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: Explicitly excluded in PRD non-goals
