# M001: Memory Database — SQLite-Backed Context Store

**Vision:** Replace GSD's markdown-file artifact loading with a SQLite database and typed query layer that selectively injects only the context each dispatch unit needs — delivering ≥30% token savings, eliminating context pollution from superseded/irrelevant data, and enabling structured LLM output that bypasses fragile markdown parsing.

## Success Criteria

- Auto-mode dispatches use DB queries for context injection across all prompt builders
- Existing GSD projects migrate silently to DB on first run with zero data loss
- Planning and research dispatch units show ≥30% fewer tokens on mature projects
- `better-sqlite3` load failure degrades gracefully to markdown loading
- Worktree creation copies gsd.db; worktree merge reconciles rows
- LLM can write decisions/requirements/summaries via structured tool calls
- `/gsd inspect` shows DB state for debugging

## Key Risks / Unknowns

- `better-sqlite3` native addon platform coverage — could fail on exotic setups
- Prompt builder rewiring is high-surface-area (9+ functions, 3800-line file) — subtle bugs possible
- Existing markdown parsers may not capture all structured fields needed for DB rows
- Schema iteration risk as real dispatch patterns reveal missing queries

## Proof Strategy

- `better-sqlite3` platform risk → retire in S01 by proving it loads, creates DB, runs queries on the target platform
- Parser coverage risk → retire in S02 by round-trip testing every artifact type (import → query → compare with original)
- Prompt builder rewiring risk → retire in S03 by running all prompt builders and comparing output with markdown-based originals
- Schema stability risk → retire in S07 by running a full auto-mode cycle on a real project

## Verification Classes

- Contract verification: unit tests for DB layer, importers, query layer, state derivation. Round-trip fidelity tests for migration.
- Integration verification: prompt builders produce equivalent output with DB vs markdown. Full auto-mode cycle completes.
- Operational verification: worktree DB copy/merge works. Graceful fallback works when better-sqlite3 unavailable. Token measurement reports savings.
- UAT / human verification: user runs auto-mode on a real project and confirms output quality is equivalent or better

## Milestone Definition of Done

This milestone is complete only when all are true:

- All prompt builders use DB queries for context injection (no more inlineGsdRootFile for data artifacts)
- Silent auto-migration works on existing GSD projects with all artifact types
- Dual-write keeps markdown files in sync with DB state
- Graceful fallback to markdown when better-sqlite3 unavailable — no crash, transparent degradation
- Token measurement shows ≥30% reduction on planning/research units for mature projects
- deriveState() derives from DB, producing identical GSDState output
- Worktree isolation and merge reconciliation work with row-level conflict detection
- Structured LLM tools eliminate markdown-then-parse roundtrip for decisions/requirements/summaries
- Full auto-mode cycle (research → plan → execute → complete) completes with DB-backed context
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Requirement Coverage

- Covers: R001, R002, R003, R004, R005, R006, R007, R008, R009, R010, R011, R012, R013, R014, R015, R016, R017, R018, R019, R020, R021
- Partially covers: none
- Leaves for later: R030 (vector search), R031 (DB export command)
- Orphan risks: none

## Slices

- [ ] **S01: DB Foundation + Decisions + Requirements** `risk:high` `depends:[]`
  > After this: SQLite DB opens with schema, decisions and requirements tables populated, active_decisions and active_requirements views return correct filtered subsets. Graceful fallback tested — system works without better-sqlite3.

- [ ] **S02: Markdown Importers + Auto-Migration** `risk:medium` `depends:[S01]`
  > After this: Existing GSD project starts up, gsd.db appears silently with all artifact types imported. Round-trip fidelity verified for every artifact type.

- [ ] **S03: Core Hierarchy + Full Query Layer + Prompt Rewiring** `risk:high` `depends:[S01,S02]`
  > After this: All build*Prompt() functions use DB queries instead of inlineGsdRootFile. Dual-write keeps markdown in sync. Prompts contain only relevant context subsets.

- [ ] **S04: Token Measurement + State Derivation from DB** `risk:medium` `depends:[S03]`
  > After this: Token counts logged per dispatch unit showing before/after savings. deriveState() reads from DB. Savings ≥30% confirmed on planning/research units with fixture data.

- [ ] **S05: Worktree Isolation + Merge Reconciliation** `risk:medium` `depends:[S01,S02]`
  > After this: Worktree creation copies gsd.db. Worktree merge does row-level reconciliation with conflict detection for divergent modifications.

- [ ] **S06: Structured LLM Tools + /gsd inspect** `risk:medium` `depends:[S03]`
  > After this: LLM writes decisions/requirements/summaries via lightweight tool calls that write to DB and trigger markdown dual-write. /gsd inspect dumps DB state.

- [ ] **S07: Integration Verification + Polish** `risk:low` `depends:[S03,S04,S05,S06]`
  > After this: Full auto-mode cycle runs entirely on DB-backed context. Token savings ≥30% confirmed on real project data. All edge cases (empty projects, partial migrations, fallback mode) verified.
