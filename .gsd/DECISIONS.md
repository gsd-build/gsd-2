| # | When | Scope | Decision | Choice | Rationale | Revisable? |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| D001 | M001 | library | SQLite library for Node.js | better-sqlite3 | Sync API matches existing sync prompt-building code. Prebuilt binaries for all LTS Node versions. Both TS and Rust can read the same file. | No |
| D002 | M001 | arch | DB file location | .gsd/gsd.db (gitignored) | DB is derived local state, not source-controlled. Each clone rebuilds from markdown or creates fresh. | No |
| D003 | M001 | arch | Fallback strategy | Graceful degradation to markdown loading | better-sqlite3 native addon may fail on exotic platforms. System must not crash — falls back transparently. | No |
| D004 | M001 | arch | Markdown file fate after migration | Dual-write (DB + markdown) | Preserves human-readable file trail, git history, and rollback path. Delete gsd.db to revert. | Yes — if DB proves fully reliable after extended use |
| D005 | M001 | arch | Worktree DB strategy | Own gsd.db per worktree with row-level merge reconciliation | Git can't merge binary SQLite files. Each worktree needs isolation. Merge uses deterministic PK strategy. | No |
| D006 | M001 | arch | Structured LLM output mechanism | Custom extension tools (gsd_save_decision, etc.) | Lightweight tool calls that write to DB and trigger dual-write. Eliminates markdown-then-parse roundtrip. User emphasized "whatever is fastest and most lightweight." | Yes — if tool reliability proves insufficient |
| D007 | M001 | convention | DB inspection | /gsd inspect slash command inside pi | Slash command, not standalone CLI. Dumps table counts, recent entries, schema version. | No |
| D008 | M001 | arch | SQLite journal mode | WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) | Faster for read-heavy workload, allows concurrent readers. Standard best practice. | No |
| D009 | M001 | arch | Migration UX | Silent auto-migration on first run | Zero friction. Detect markdown files without gsd.db → import atomically → log one-line summary. | No |
